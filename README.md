# Project Details : Look up for output Video
Provided with the distance based sensory information at different positions in the given environment, this project aimed to identify the robot's current position. The red arrow in the above video is the actual position of the robot and every blue point is where the program identified the probable position of the robot. 

As an extension, it was demonstrated how resampling in such a environment could help the robot identify its location if its lost or purposely misplaced.
